# 🔢 MathHub  

MathHub is a **living repository of mathematics**, gathering proofs, problems, conjectures, algorithms, and applications.  
The goal is to create a structured and evolving resource that blends **theory** and **practice**, enriched with code in Python and R when needed.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- `theory/` → Pure math notes, proofs, conjectures (number theory, algebra, analysis).  
- `problems/` → Exercises and contests (Putnam-style, Olympiads).  
- `algorithms/` → Python and R implementations of mathematical algorithms.  
- `applications/` → Applied math (finance, statistics, probability models).  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (Python) and RMarkdown files (R).  
- `pdf/` → Compiled notes and demonstrations in PDF format.  

## 🎯 Goals  

- Explore diverse areas of mathematics, from pure theory to real-world applications.  
- Combine **rigor** (proofs, conjectures) with **experimentation** (algorithms, code, simulations).  
- Build an open reference that grows over time and welcomes contributions.  

## 📝 Possible Topics  

- Number theory (primes, divisibility, Goldbach’s conjecture).  
- Combinatorics and probability (counting, random walks, Monte Carlo).  
- Analysis (inequalities, convergence, series, real/complex problems).  
- Putnam-style problems and elegant solutions.  
- Algorithms (Euclidean algorithm, optimization, numerical methods).  
- Applied mathematics (finance, Black-Scholes, statistics, stochastic models).  

## 🚀 How to Use  

- Browse the **PDFs** for structured notes.  
- Explore **Python notebooks** and **R scripts** for implementations.  
- Navigate folders by theme for focused topics.
